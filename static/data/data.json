As I gain more professional experience, I'll actively refactor my portfolios with a strong base of experience, showcasing contributions to real-world projects, writing technical blogs, and potentially contributing to open-source initiatives. My ultimate specialization lies in cybersecurity; therefore, I plan to learn and apply to cybersecurity by pursuing to this industry, engaging in hands-on labs and CTFs, and networking within the cybersecurity community to eventually transition into a specialized role in the field."

At the same time, I want to graduate from college with honors, keeping up solid grades, and working hard to get ready for the capstone project and future classes.  Even before my official internship begins, I will actively look for ways to obtain experience in the corporate world.  This entails going to online career fairs, connecting with industry experts on LinkedIn, and looking into volunteer or freelance coding projects to put my abilities to use. At the same time, I'll start to restructure my portfolio by adding these enhanced academic assignments and any fresh experiences, emphasizing clear explanations, clean code, and a solid foundation of proven abilities."
